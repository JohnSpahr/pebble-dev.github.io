## Why Rebble Web Services?

The Pebble watch is called a smartwatch. That's because it's smarter than a normal watch. Part of that intelligence is incorporated into the watch, and part of it is being delivered through web services. Originally, these web services were provided by Pebble Technology, Corp. However, Pebble Technology, Corp. halted operation, and after some time these web services have disappeared as well. That made the Pebble watch a lot dumber. Not as dumb as a normal watch, but things that were possible before, aren't possible any more. Time to ditch your Pebble? No, because...

Enter Rebble! The Rebble Alliance has created Rebble Web Services, to fill in the void left by the disappearance of Pebble Technology, Corp. Most of the services that have disappeared, have replacements now. There's however one thing The Rebble Alliance cannot do: change every Pebble so it will use the Rebble Web Services. This needs some action by the user. No need to worry, we'll help you step by step! Read on...

## Getting started using Rebble Web Services

So, you have a Pebble watch, and want to start using it. Let's go! 

Just follow the instructions at [help.rebble.io/setup](https://help.rebble.io/setup)

## General hints

* As many services on the watch are actually implemented in the phone and in web services, many issues are located there as well. A reboot of your phone has better chance to fix issues, than a reboot of your watch. Restoring your watch to factory settings is hardly ever needed.
* If you have issues with dictation, you should check the weather service to rule out issues with your subscription. If weather works in Timeline or through the Weather Channel app, then your subscription is working fine.
* If watchfaces are not syncing from your account, you might need to run the [boot process](https://boot.rebble.io) again or reinstall the app.
* Apple users: If you have the iOS app already installed on an old device, be sure to back up your IPA (for free) with [iMazing](https://imazing.com)! This allows you to load the app on all of your newer devices without having to sign it every week, as it is tied to your Apple ID.
* Android users: Congratulations! You can just grab the recently-updated APK and relax.
