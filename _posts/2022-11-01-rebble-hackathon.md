Time flies when you're having fun. It's been a year since our last blog post announcing the launch of the [Rebble developer portal](https://dev-portal.rebble.io) and in that time we've seen a whole host of new apps and watchfaces submitted to [the appstore](https://apps.rebble.io). Rebble continues to have an amazing community behind it, so in this blog post we're going to take a look at a few highlights from the last year and announce our first hackathon. But first, how many of us actually are there...?

# The Rebble Alliance
One question we've always been interested to know the answer to is "how many Rebble users are there?". Rebble web services logs give a rough estimate, but we've never known for sure. A few months ago we deployed an update to RWS that listens for the analytics data the Pebble app sends home. We only store the non-personal information from it, but that's enough for us to see the result: 24,000 Rebble users!!

Now, this number should be taken with a pinch of salt as some of these pings will be from users with the Rebble'd Pebble app installed who are not actively using their Pebbles still, but if we just look at pings from devices with watches connected we get a healthy 16,000 Rebbles! We can also see that these days the majority of users are on Android, due to the fact that the app can [still be side-loaded](https://rebble.io/apk) unlike on iOS.

Speaking of the Android app leads nicely into the second part of this post:

# The Android app gets an update

Fitbit absorbed Pebble. Google absorbed Fitbit. Despite the Pebble app being a double hand-me-down, we recently saw the android app get it's first update in X years to become 64 bit, thereby allowing it to be installed on the Pixel 7 - The first Android phone to mandate this feature.

A massive thank you to Google for putting the effort in to support an app so old it isn't even hosted on their own app store!

# Announcing Rebble Hackathon #001

We're thrilled to announce we're running our first hackathon on the 18th - 20th of November. We're hoping it's the first of many too, hence the optimistic 3 digit name! It's a bit of an experiment on our part, but the idea is anyone who wants to take part simply [fills out the form](), [sets up their dev environment](), and joins in on that weekend in building a fun watchface, watchapp, or tool for the Pebble watch.

Everyone who [uploads an app]() to the appstore during the hackathon will recieve free Rebble stickers, and our favourite submission(s) will recieve a special prize (likely to be a pebble watch!)

For more information and live updates, check out the [dedicated hackathon page](/hackathon-001). For even livelier updates be sure to follow us [on twitter](https://twitter.com/pebble_dev). During the hackathon weekend we'll have dedicated channels [on Discord](/discord) too.
