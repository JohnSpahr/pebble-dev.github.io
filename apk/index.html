		<h1> Android APK Download </h1>

		The original Pebble app for Android is no longer available on the Google Play Store.
		<br>
		Rebble hosts the latest version of the APK, which you can download below:<br><br>
		<a class="button orange" href="https://binaries.rebble.io/apks/pebble-4.4.2.apk">Download Android App</a>
		<p><strong>If you use a Pixel 7</strong>, the above APK will not work. Instead, you can use
			<a href="https://binaries.rebble.io/apks/pebble-4.4.2-pixel7-rbl.apk">this special APK patched for Pixel 7</a>.
			If you use this, Google Fit integration will not work. There is currently no workaround available
			for Google Fit on Pixel 7.
