## Rebble

### Where do I start?

Well, right here! At least, for frequently asked questions about *The Rebble Alliance*. For frequently asked questions about how to use the Rebble Web Services with your Pebble smartwatch, head to [the setup and troubleshooting how-to](/howto) and scroll down.

### What is Rebble?

Rebble began as a supplement to the [official Pebble documentation](https://developer.pebble.com/).  After [Pebble ceased operations](https://blog.getpebble.com/2016/12/07/fitbit/), it morphed into the unofficial spearhead organization for continuing the advancement of the Pebble platform via the amazing Pebble developer community.  

### What does Rebble do?

Our present focus is on replacing key pieces of the Pebble ecosystem: the appstore and related web services, and later on down the road, potentially even firmware and mobile apps.  At a higher level, our goal is to maintain and advance Pebble functionality, in the absence of *Pebble Technology Corp*.  

### Who is Rebble?

Find out on our [team](/team) page! In short, though, a collection of dedicated tech enthusiasts who love the Pebble smartwatch perhaps a little too much.

### Where can I learn more about Rebble?

Join us on the official [Rebble Alliance Discord server](http://discord.gg/aRUAYFN), then browse the channels to find out what we're up to! :bowtie:  

### How can I help out?
